# The Selector

The website was create as a support tool to help users on their last step in a decission making process.

It is a tool that pushes users to undestand how important certain elements are in their decission making process, how they can limit them to the essential and at the end, how they can filter their options in order to reach again, the essential.

It then uses a calculation methodology to manipulate their data in order to be able too make an informed recommandation

The idea originates in my own experience as a procuremenet professional and is something that I intend to use in order to support my decission making process.

## Scope
The website was created to satisfy one main requirement/objective, which is to support a decission making process.
However, The Selector was developed in order to provide a wider area of flexibility for the user, from defining the characteristics they value, asigning them priorities, selecting between 2 and 3 options to offering them a wider range of possibility when scoring their items of interest.

Although a simple tool, my hope is for it to target an extremly wide audience with it`s usability and unlimited application area.

##  User Experience

#### First Time Visitor Target:
* Provide an easy to understand interface with clear instructions on what the application does and how to use.
* Offer a solution for a decission they need to make on a wide range of applications and domains, from home to professional use.
* Have the capability to store their data by printing the page and potentially use them at a later stage, or attaching them as supporting documentation on a report.
* Provide a fun way to either generate an informed and calculated decission or use a "coin flip" by using the generate random section.

####  Returning Visitor Target:
* Application does not represent a one time use, but a tool that can be integrated in your activity as a professional, or at home in each users personal life.
* For professionals it can represent a standardized process and format that can be included in their reporting process.

#### Frequent Visitors Target:
* Unlimited target audience and usability, as it clearly targets a need applicable in all areas from professionals to home use, on all demographics.
* Users are expected to integrate the application as as a standard part of their decission making process due to it`s simplicity and still informed way of determining it`s recommandations.

## Design
The general design idea was to: 
* Maintain a clean direction with clearly identifiable and accessible areas even when resizing into small screen sizes.
* Inspire a religious theme through proper use of fonts, colours and images.
* High impactful hero image in order to highlight the size of the community and the extremely beautiful environment used for service.
* Use a cusomizable design proposal that can resize into smaller sizes without creating a high level of complexity.

#### Wireframes
In order to support development, wireframes where created for each individual page in Balsamiq.

* Home:
![Alt text](/readme/wireframe/home-page-wf.jpg)
* About:
![Alt text](/readme/wireframe/about-us-page-wf.jpg)
* Media:

* Contact:
![Alt text](/readme/wireframe/contact-page-wf.jpg)
* Form submit redirect page:
![Alt text](/readme/wireframe/redirect-page-wf.jpg)
* 404 Customized page:
![Alt text](/readme/wireframe/404-page-wf.jpg)

#### Theme
Theme of the website was thought in a way that it would address:
* The religious aspect through use of neutral, clear, clean fonts and style, and by using strong religious themed photos and other media content.
* Through use of the underline on the menu items, to push also the Romanian National theme.
* Clear and clean design in order to address all targeted users.
* Provide a message easy to understand and easy to access.
* Highlight key elements: schedule, events, location, media content, Facebook link.
* Provide a direction that is easy to be followed and implemented in various screen sizes/devices.

#### Colour Selection
Colour selection done in order to be aligned with the thematic of the website and to provide appropriate style while maintaining clarity and accessibility for all.
A splash of colour was added by the introduction of the menu decorations representing the Romanian national colours. Choice was taken in order to again support the websites thematic.
![Alt text](/readme/other/colour-pallete.jpg)


#### Font and text style
Text and font used are consistent across the website with variances in regards of decoration and size.
Font used was selected from Google Fonts:

#### Imagery
Hero image was taken by a local photographer called [Zamfir Constantin](https://www.zamfirphoto.com/). Image was shared by him in order to support building the website.
Other images in About page where taken from [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/) which offers a free for commercial use collection of photography.

#### Features

* GENERAL:
Website contains 6 pages from which 4 are visible and accessible from main menu and another 2 are a reaction to a users action.
Menu and Header structure remains the same but changes in design with different screen size resolutions.
I`ve created 2 menus:
    * one that is used for resolution above 600px, which is the standard menu.
    * one that is used for resolutions under 600px which transforms the HOME menu section into a font-awesome house logo.
On both menus, the text data changes to same colour as underline when hovered over.
![Alt text](/readme/other/header-resizing.jpg)

Footer information remains the same across all pages and screen resolutions and has a fixed position containing a Facebook link for community`s Facebook page.
![Alt text](/readme/other/footer.jpg)


* HOME: 
Contains 4 main section:
    * Hero image with a text section on a blured background linked to the About section.
    * Schedule and Events which share the same height and sit side by side under Hero image; intention is that the website will allow to build additional blocks in the same format; purpose of this 2 sections is to inform on schedule and activities.
    * Quote of the month section.

* ABOUT:
Contains 2 main sections:
    * Information about the community with links to different sections of the website: contact, schedule, location.
    * Image section which in desktop mode is positioned on right and in mobile moves to bottom of the page above footer.

* MEDIA:
Contains 3 main section:
    * A timeline feature that allows for the user to select a specific month, and when selected, the webpage will move to the media info for that particular month; position of timeline remains fixed and for resoltions under 600px disappears completely due to real-estate availability.
![Alt text](/readme/other/timeline-feature.jpg)

    * Description section that details the objective of the page.
    * Media data, structured by month and connected to the timeline feature; each media data contains a description of the presented content; media data used was implemented with iframe functionality  based on YouTube created links;

* CONTACT:  
Contains 2 main sections:
    * Contact form which collects the main user contact data(first and last name as well as the email data), allows the user to select his interest areas for which he wants to be notified, and the submit button; submit button changes colour once hovered over.
    * Map for Church`s 2 locations, which allow the user, if opened on a mobile device, to open in Google Maps and use tp navigate; map data was implemented through iframe functionality based on Google Maps created links

* FORM REDIRECT:
Page visible only when submit button in form page is pushed. Page acts as a temporary redirect page that will confirm form was submitted and notify user will be redirected to main page in 10 seconds.

* 404 PAGE:
Page designed in order to provide 404 customized message and experience.


#### Accessibility
From an accessibility perspective, my goal was to create a clean website with data easy to read, positioned in a relevant manner for the user.
I`ve achieved this by:
* Writing semantic HTML
* Correct selection of text size and font in order to contrast well with the other elements of the page.
* Selection of photos used based on high resolution, good contrast.
* As majority of photos where implemented as background, titles where used instead of alt attributes.

Another area I was mindful of, was that all of the consideration above where not lost when using the website in smaller screen sizes.


#### Display size optimization
![Alt text](/readme/other/responsive-view.jpg)
Several size options where used when developing the responsive design.
Please see bellow a list and the main areas of impact when implemented:

* from 1200px wide and down: Mostly resizing of different elements but without major structural changes.
* from 954px wide and down: Elements moved into a stacked format on all pages in order to display correctly, one elements per full page width. The other change is the resizing and positioning of Menu under Logo in a central position.
* from 800px wide and down: Mostly resizing of different elements but without other major structural changes.
* from 600px wide and down: Home menu tab replaced with font-awesome home icon by hiding the standard menu and moving to the second variant optimized for mobile. The other major change is the removal of the timeline feature in the media page, change done due to reduced real-estate on lower screen-size devices.
* from 425px wide and down: Mostly resizing of different elements but without other major structural changes.
* min resolution tested was for iPhone SE, but verified that resolutions under la Galaxy Fold still behave well with major change being a shift in menu structure to a stacked version vs a side by side tab presentation.



## Testing and Validation
The website was tested for functionality and design using the following browsers: Mozilla, Chrome, Edge.
There where also other external tools listed in the section Technologies that where used to ensure correct website 
and code behaviour.
A formator was also used in order to clean and arrange code.

#### HTML
Tested all pages using W3C validator.
Several errors identified in all pages, and corrections made, like for ex:
* missing lang attribute and doctype in 404 page
* duplications of containers or double used closing container commands

Issues identified and corrected until bellow pass mark was reached:
![Alt text](/readme/testing/html-test.jpg)

#### CSS
Tested CSS code using W3C validation service.
Several errors identified, majority around using commands not valid or doubled: background-colour same as border colour for ex.

Issues are fixed and corrected, the only item still open is the imported style sheet:
![Alt text](/readme/testing/css-validator.jpg)


#### Accessibility Test
Accessibility test was done using Wave Report generator, for each of the pages.
There where several issues identified which where corrected, mostly due to font colour used on Menu tabs. Media and About page initially used a white text colour on a yellow background. This was corrected with the final version currently in place and errors fixed.

There are 3 errors still in place:
* 2 impacting all pages due to icons being used with a link to a page associated. Since the icons don`t have text, errors where not fixed but they should not impact user experience as the icons used present very suggestive meaning, and generaly used in web-development.
* 1 error impacting the form redirect page(page after submission) and this is due to the redirect function of the page.

#### Local functionality tests
All tests performed considered both desktop and mobile version.
Link to full local functionality test: [TESTING.MD](https://github.com/mtopircean/project1/blob/main/TESTING.md)

#### Fixed bugs

Majority of bugs and errors where addressed when dealing with the development of each individual section, and where considered a step in completion of different sections.

* HOME Page quote section not being displayed completly: resized the margins of the section.
```
#quote {
    position: relative;
    text-align: center;
    margin-top: 20px;
    margin-bottom: 20px;
    padding: 20px;
    font-style: italic;
    font-size: 1rem;
}
```

* MEDIA Page footer rising on top of the last video: resized margins of the video sections in order to create a separation against the footer.
```
#all-video {
    float: right;
    width: 84%;
    margin-right: 20px;
    margin-bottom: 40px;
}
```

* MEDIA Page timeline error when clicking a specific month not visible in the video section. Error was causing the display to flicker and return to current section: error fixed by removing duplicate code added by mistake during development.

* HTML W3C validator testing, highlighting error "The frameborder attribute on the iframe element is obsolete": Error fixed based on guideline from Benji_5P_cohort_lead on removing the frameborder element from iframe.

*After a zoom in was spotted when opened website in desktop browser, it was identified that a padding on the header was creating a misalignment with other elements in other pages.
Once corrected this triggered several adjustments that had to be done in order to realign elements. Corrections took place on all pages and touched mostly on size of elements, padding and margin values.

No other known bugs or errors.
